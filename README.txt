This project focused on building an intelligent Tetris-playing agent using genetic algorithms and heuristic evaluation functions. By implementing a Tetris game in Python with the Pygame library, the development process included integrating artificial intelligence and employing natural evolution strategies to optimize the agent's decision-making. The AI was trained to consider factors like block clearance and hole minimization, using specific grid parameters for decision precision. Rigorous performance evaluation showcased the success of the AI agent, allowing users to play Tetris independently and observe genetic algorithm training. Overcoming challenges in learning new libraries and principles of genetic algorithms, this project demonstrated the power and potential of AI in game development, emphasizing the effectiveness of genetic algorithms for future projects in the field.

To launch the application:
1. Oped Dist Folder
2. Run Tetris.exe

In game:
1. If the game does not load, try to maximise the console window
2. To choose the game options, press 1,2 or 3
3. Game options 2 and 3 only to observe the gameplay by the AI agents, however they still accept the keyboard input, therefore please do not press any movement keys when in these
modes. (To exit to main menu press "Escape")
4. Note that the option 2 and option 3 use the key simulations for the tetromino movement, therefore if the program is running and you minimise the game window
the key simulation presses will still be working until the application is closed. (Simulation presses only imitates the arrow keys on a keyboard)
5. The console which opens only provides additional information when the game Option 3 is chosen (GAs Process) in other cases this consode window can be ignored.

Enjoy the Tetris! :)
